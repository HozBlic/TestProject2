	DATABASE:
For this PHP system to work, a connection to a database is needed. I used MySQL, made a connection using 
phpmyadmin through WAMPserver. Host: "localhost" Username: "root" Password: "" Name: "scandiwebtest"
	!!!Database "scandiwebtest" has to exsist before running website.!!!
	!!!Tables "Type", "Product", "Furniture", "DVD", "Book" have to exsist and table "Type" must contain types, 
	before running website, SQL script "before.sql" is included in folder "sql".!!!
For dummy data you can use testdata.sql
